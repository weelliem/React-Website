## Prerequisites
* **React Native**
is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. 

## Libaries
* **Frammer Motion**
shares the simple animation and gesture API as the Framer library, while maintaining HTML and SVG semantics. This makes it simple to port your high-fidelity prototypes to a production-ready environment, or make something completely new!

* **BootStrap**
is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.

* **React Router Dom**
A tool that allows you to handle routes in a web app, using dynamic routing. Dynamic routing takes place as the app is rendering on your machine, unlike the old routing architecture where the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app.

* **React Spring**
is a spring-physics based animation library that should cover most of your UI related animation needs. It gives you tools flexible enough to confidently cast your ideas into moving interfaces. ... It inherits animated's powerful interpolations and performance, as well as react-motion's ease of use.

## Bugs
* The position and resizing of the website needs to be fixed
